Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.
    IP,copyright,patent, trade secret
    trademark 

IP is protected in law by, for example, patents, copyright and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create. By striking the right balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest, the IP system aims to foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish.

An IP attorney is a lagal professional who practices intellectual property law, which ensures companies and individuals have ownership rights over their invented or created materials. IP law includes six different areas:

    Patent law: Patents protect rights to new inventions, technologies, computer programs or certain industrial processes. Patent laws can write these documents or negotiate cases involving patents.

    Copyright law: Copyrights protect creative authors' rights and determine who can control and use a property. Artists, photographers, musicians and writers use copyrights and copyright lawyers to protect their creative work.

    Trademark law: Trademark law protects slogans, logos and business names. Trademark lawyers create and file paperwork to protect these symbols. They can also file lawsuits or reach negotiations to help their clients secure trademark rights.

    Licensing: Licensing allows someone other than the property owner to use a created good for a set fee. For example, if a movie producer wants to use a musician's song in their soundtrack, the producer needs to have a license granting them this permission. License laws help draft and negotiate these documents.

    Trade secret law: Trade secret laws protect companies to own certain formulas or methods of production. In this law specialty, attorneys work to register these processes.

    Unfair competition: Competition laws ensure companies produce and trade goods fairly. A competition lawyer may defend customers or companies.

What does an IP attorney do?

An IP attorney works to protect intellectual properties. Their responsibilities may include:

    Advising clients on legal rights and actions involving intellectual property

    Representing clients in the courtroom

    Consulting legal clients and advising them on certain IP documents, such as patents or licenses

    Reviewing and creating important legal documents, including patents and trademark papers

    Drafting new contracts or licensing agreements

    Conducting research and interviews to help with court cases or legal proceedings

    Collaborating with trademark and patent offices

    Negotiating legal settlements and filing lawsuits

    Transferring ownership rights of intellectual property

Average salary for an IP attorney

The national average salary for one type of IP attorney, a patent attorney, is $150,802 per year

. The salary for an IP attorney varies depending on their area of focus, geographical location and level of experience. This career often has additional benefits such as health insurance, stock options and commuter assistance.
Requirements to become an IP attorney

IP attorneys must meet certain requirements before they can practice law. These requirements vary depending on location and the type of IP law, but they typically include the following:
Bachelor's degree in relevant field

IP lawyers must first earn their bachelor's degree. Some IP attorneys, such as those in copywriting or trade secret, can study general topics before entering law school. Many IP attorneys, such as patent lawyers or trademark attorneys, review highly detailed material about specialized topics. For these roles, they must have an undergraduate degree in a relevant technical field. For example, if a patent lawyer wants to create patents for new computers, they will need to have an undergraduate degree in computer science. These technical majors can include:

    Engineering

    Computer science

    Software design

    Mathematics

    Biology

    Physics

    Chemistry

The Law School Admissions Test (LSAT)

After earning their undergraduate degrees, IP attorneys must take the LSAT and receive a high score before applying to law school programs. This test assesses the candidate's analytical reasoning skills and legal knowledge.

A law degree

To become an IP attorney, professionals need to attend law school and earn a Juris Doctor degree. This degree takes three years to complete. During their first year, law students study general law concepts. In their second and third years, they can focus on specialized areas. IP lawyers may choose to study patent law or trade laws depending on their interests and career goals.

The state bar examination

After graduating from law school, graduates can take their state's bar examination. This test will vary depending on the location, but it typically involves multiple days of verbal and written assessments. Bar examiners review the assessments and determine if the candidate passed.
Law license

With a passing bar exam, lawyers can earn their law license to become practicing attorneys. The state licenses will review a candidate's bar exam, educational experience and character references before approving a law license.
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office registration

Most IP attorneys will work with patents and trademarks and need to register with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To register, licensed attorneys must complete an application, provide evidence of their undergraduate studies in a relevant field and then pass the USPTO exam. If an IP attorney focuses on copyrights or trade secrets, they may not need to register with the USPTO.
Important skills for an IP attorney

In order to be successful, IP attorneys should have the following skills:
Communication

IP attorneys need strong communication skills to talk to clients, judges and other lawyers. Clear communication can help lawyers advise clients and explain legal concepts. If an IP lawyer works in a courtroom, they may also need to develop strong negotiation skills to help them reach legal agreements and settlements.
Organization

IP lawyers manage many types of paperwork and written documents. Strong organizational skills can help lawyers file and access all documents. This can keep client information secure. IP attorneys can also use organizational skills to manage their schedules and multiple clients.
Attention to detail

Accuracy is very important in IP law because all patents and contrast need to be correct to protect clients' rights. IP attorneys need to review and edit all paperwork to ensure the information is correct. Detail-orientation can help lawyers when producing and revising materials.
Writing

IP attorneys produce a lot of written documents. Depending on their area, they may write patents, trademark documents or licensing contracts. Researching, outline, drafting and grammar skills can help lawyers produce strong, clear content.
Analytical reasoning

In IP law, attorneys look at a lot of information and analyze it to reach conclusions. Strong analytic skills can help them reach decisions and solve problems for their clients.

Technical knowledge

IP lawyers work with complicated material for specialized topics. They need technical knowledge and understandings of these fields to succeed. For example, an IP lawyer who creates patents for a biotech company will need to have a background in biology or chemistry. They need to analyze and discuss scientific tables, diagrams and spreadsheets in order to produce the patents.

data1 = """Claxton hunting first major medal

British hurdler Sarah Claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid.

The 25-year-old has already smashed the British record over 60m hurdles twice this season, setting a new mark of 7.96 seconds to win the AAAs title. "I am quite confident," said Claxton. "But I take each race as it comes. "As long as I keep up my training but not do too much I think there is a chance of a medal." Claxton has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage. Now, the Scotland-born athlete owns the equal fifth-fastest time in the world this year. And at last week's Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot.

For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form. In previous seasons, the 25-year-old also contested the long jump but since moving from Colchester to London she has re-focused her attentions. Claxton will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the European Indoors which take place on 5-6 March."""

Watchdog probes e-mail deletions

The information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.

Richard Thomas "totally condemned" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served "no current purpose", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.

Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was "too unlikely to have been a coincidence", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or "the destruction of important records". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the "e-mail regime" could "support the freedom of information regime".

Mr Thomas said: "The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence." He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.

"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. "But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned." The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner."""
data3 = """Many law students and young lawyers are fascinated by the idea of working in IP law. On one count, many of them enjoy reading copyright law or patent law concepts and come to imagine that they will like IP law as a career. 

Unfortunately, practising IP law is nothing like discussing what is copyrightable and what is an inventive step in a patent claim in a 4th-year classroom in law school. 

I have met many young lawyers who joined some IP law firm after graduation out of this misconception and then were disillusioned within months. 

However, IP law is truly an amazing area of practice if you have the right expectations and you prepare for success. Let me tell you why IP is one of the best legal careers to pursue in today’s day and age.  
Association with creativity and innovation

It is undeniable that IP law can expose you to more intellectual and finer aspects of human experience, especially creativity, art, and innovation as opposed say capital markets, project finance, criminal law, or M&A!

Every piece of intellectual property has some creative aspects to it. If you are a creative or intellectual person, you may enjoy the proximity with art, innovation, literature. It is not just proximity, but engaging on a daily basis with art, literature, and innovation is pretty much the job of IP lawyers. Sure it will not feel that way if you are filing forms all day for registration of some kind of IP, but it gets better once you start getting seniority and work on contentious stuff.

There is no limit to what human beings can invent, and how far patent lawyers will go to assail or defend that innovation for their client’s commercial gains. 

Imagine lawyers who have to watch movies or stand up comedy to determine whether it is original work or a copyright claim can be brought against it. 

Or whether a trademark is deceptively similar to another! 

As an IP lawyer, you also get many opportunities to come up with creative and innovative arguments as well, and that may satisfy your hunger for original work.

I, for example, love doing something creative. It quenches some kind of inner thirst for creativity and innovation. I guess that is why I absolutely love writing and have been trying to learn the piano.

It is often said that we should choose a profession that does not merely make money, but where our passion lies. Many young law graduates find it highly inspiring and intellectually stimulating to work on challenging IP matters.
Association with popular culture and cultural icons

A lot of people want to join IP law because they will get to work with their favourite stars, cultural icons, or popular brands.

This is true. IP lawyers do get to work with top scientists, authors, artists, creators, movie stars, even top sportspersons. They act for big brands as well.

How many of you will like to work with Marvel or DC or even Netflix? Maybe you will like to work for FIFA or IPL?

All of these companies need trademark lawyers all the time and sometimes, copyright lawyers too. Enforcing their branding rights and protecting their content from piracy all around the globe requires them to engage small armies of copyright and trademark lawyers.

You can also get to work with companies that are changing the direction of our civilization as a patent lawyer - such as Tesla, Qualcomm, or Alphabet - they all hire top patent lawyers all the time.
Intellectual property law practice is hot because of burgeoning tech and media sectors

As things stand today, technology and media are the two horsemen of IP Law.

The technology sector is seeing big growth thanks to emerging technologies - solar, 5G, biotech, automated transportation, e-commerce, fintech, food technology.

Media has been the fastest growing industry around the globe for the last 10 years and is likely to grow fast on the back of ubiquitous smartphone and internet connection. 

Both of these sectors are IP intensive. Not only registration of patent, copyright, and trademark, but these industries are also generating a massive amount of work related to licensing, franchising, assignment of IP, IP prosecution as well as enforcement of IP rights globally.

Of course, there is considerable work from other sectors like manufacturing, FMCG, retail, fashion and luxury, and pharma as well, but tech and media have been the biggest drivers of growth.

It is important to note that due to a strong connection with these emerging sectors IP has not been particularly hit like most other areas of law practice after the pandemic. If you want a recession-proof career, IP is really solid for that.
IP law is an area of practice with a lot of international exposure and foreign clients

IP is by nature an international practice. If you are registering a patent, you probably want to cover several major markets around the world. Similarly, if you are looking to register a trademark, especially for a global or international brand, the scope for international work is massive as they probably want to register it in many different countries. 

Also, you get a lot of high paying foreign clients if you are a good IP lawyer. A lot of work is related to global enforcement of IP apart from local work.

Also, IP law is pretty similar across the world. Most major economies today comply with the TRIPS agreement, which is an acronym for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. As a result of this, IP laws vary only in a minor way in different jurisdictions. 

This gives IP lawyers a big advantage when it comes to creating an international practice, or even migrating to other jurisdictions including developing countries like the USA, Canada, or Australia that are rather a migration friendly. 

Many Indian lawyers have managed to get into international academia after studying IP law thanks to the cross-border relevance and similarity of IP laws. If you want to teach abroad after studying law in India, IP law specialization should be one of your top picks, apart from subjects like competition law and international trade.
IP law pays well

IP is a very well paid area of work because of the specialized nature of work, the criticality of performance, and rich corporate clients. Indian IP practice prospered after globalization as hordes of international MNCs landed in India to do business thanks to the opened markets.

As the global importance of India as a fast-growing market for consumer goods, technology, media, automobiles, and luxury items continue to grow, IP law practice in India will thrive.

As law firms continue to compete for talent, salary in IP law practice will remain strong.

Interestingly, over the years, high profile law firms in IP have shifted from doing a lot of registration to doing more litigation, as the IP law market had matured. In the future, we can expect more well-paid jobs for lawyers who are good at IP prosecution and IP litigation.

Top IP law firms pay between INR 70,000 - INR 1,00,000 at the entry-level to fresh lawyers, while tier 2 law firms pay between INR 40,000 - 70,000. Smaller shops can pay between INR 25,000 - 40,000. Partners with 10 years of experience can earn between INR 50 lakhs -1 crore or more. Of course, those who manage to set up their own law firms or even independent law practices and are able to attract clients independently grow fastest"""
data4 = """Politics, in general, is the platform by which people create, maintain, and change the laws that govern their lives. As a result, conflict and collaboration are inextricably connected in politics. On the one hand, the presence of conflicting views, competing expectations, competing needs, and competing interests is expected to result in conflict over the rules under which people live.

Politics is fascinating because everyone has a different perspective on life and its rules. They have differing opinions about how they should live. What money should go to whom? What is the best way to disperse power to help the powerless? Is it better for society to be built on collaboration or conflict? And so forth. They also talk about how such disputes can be resolved. What is the best way to make decisions as a group? In what conditions does who have a say? How much say should each person have in decisions? The list goes on.

This, according to Aristotle, made politics the "master science," which he described as "the action by which human beings strive to better their lives and build and contribute to a Good Society." Politics is, first and foremost, a social practice. It's still a conversation, but the parties have reduced it to a monologue.

Any effort to grasp the sense of the word "politics" must always grapple with two major issues. The first is the different connotations that this word has in everyday speech. Unlike economics, geography, history, and biology, which most people think of as academic subjects, few people approach politics without preconceptions. The second, more complicated issue is that even well-respected authorities cannot agree about what politics is all about. It has infiltrated nearly every aspect of society.

Hence, we can say that the exercise of authority, the sacred science of governance, the making of unified decisions, the distribution of limited resources, the art of deceit and exploitation, and so on are all terms used to describe politics."""
